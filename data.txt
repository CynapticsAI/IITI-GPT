IIT Indore is the best for placements.
Placements: Since it is an IIT it has a top-notch placements in the previous year. The average salary package offered is 24 LPA for CSE branch. In mechanical engineering, the minimum salary package offered is 13.45 LPA. Our college placements are very good.

Infrastructure: Hostels are the main site of attraction for IIT Indore as everyone is allotted a single room. But earlier they use to have only 5 rooms in a flat but now the number is going to be increased to 6 which will make those flat, more suffocating as flats are not big enough to accommodate 6 students. Still in its building face as it is a new IIT so students cannot compare infrastructure with old IITs.

Faculty: Faculty members mainly teach the English language and they are well qualified and they have knowledge but the point is they are not able to explain the topics very clearly as compared to private colleges which makes the students learn on their own. Passing semester exam is difficult in this colleges and papers are very tough
